"""How every ladder rung asks the model for an Explained answer.

One format for all rungs, so the only thing that changes from rung to rung is
what the model is shown - which is the point of the Comparison ladder. Every
rung uses the same model and the same reasoning effort.

The reply is JSON and becomes the answer contract in checker.py:
  {"not_found": bool, "final_answer": str,
   "steps": [{"text": str, "quote": str | null, "source": evidence id | null}]}

# v3: the same as an ordered decision (v2 still refused A10 outright), and no
# opening "Yes"/"No" the excerpts do not settle (v2 on A13: "Yes. ...").

A student asks a question about their course. Below are excerpts from THEIR

that excerpt that support the step (word for word, at most about 25 words),
and in "source" give that excerpt's id. A step that is pure arithmetic on
quoted numbers may have a null quote and source.

Decide in this order:
1. The excerpts answer the question: answer it.
2. They answer only part of it, or only one reasonable reading of it (e.g.
   "when is it due?" could ask for the date or for the time of day): answer
   that part, then say plainly in "final_answer" what your
   materials don't say ("...; your materials don't say whether ..."). Keep
   "not_found" false. Do not stretch what they say to cover the rest.
3. They answer no part and no reading of it: do not guess - set "not_found"
   to true, give no steps, and set "final_answer" to "Not found in your
   materials".
Do not open with "Yes" or "No" unless the excerpts settle that yes/no.
