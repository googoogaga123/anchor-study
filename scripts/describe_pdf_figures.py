"""Phase 2, step 5b: Diagram descriptions for the pictures inside a PDF.

Docling reads a PDF's text layer; a graph has none, so it leaves an
`<!-- image -->` placeholder and the graph is invisible to search and to the
answering model. In MidtermSampleSolutions.pdf that is 11 graphs, several of
them the only place a number is given (p. 14: where each marginal-benefit line
meets the axes).

For each picture, in document order:

  1. Crop    the picture's box (from Docling's JSON) out of the rendered page
             -> parsed/figures/<stem>_p<page>_<n>.png
  2. Describe one pass for what it is, its text, and - for a chart - its axes,
             lines, points and shaded areas (FIGURE_PROMPT). Arrows are left
             out of this pass: they are read READINGS times and voted on
             (diagram_connections.py), as for the two PNGs.
  3. Insert  the description replaces that picture's placeholder in
             <stem>.md and <stem>.pages.md, so its chunk cites the PDF page.
             Its "## " headings become bold lines: a heading would open a new
             chunk section and cut the graph off from its question.

Model: GPT-5.6 Luna (record 0005; course material goes to OpenAI only). Tested
before use on the p. 5 and p. 14 graphs, 3 runs each: axes, lines, labelled
points and tick values agreed in 3 of 3 and matched the image; one of 3 runs
misread a small arrow - hence the vote for arrows.

Every PDF is listed, the IS114 PDF too: inside it, its pictures answer its own
text (the FAQ "Where to find the revision quizzes?" is answered only by a
screenshot).

Same picture as a Library image: reuse that image's reviewed description
instead of a new reading. A PDF picture counts as the same when its pixels
correlate >= MATCH with the image (both shrunk to 48x48 grey). On the eval
Library: the IS114 FAQ screenshot vs IS114_eLearn_Quizzes_tab.png 0.59; every
other pair 0.13 or less. Why reuse: every OpenAI model tried (Luna, Terra, Sol,
GPT-5.5, o3) reads that screenshot's arrow as pointing at "Assignments" - its
tip overlaps that word - while it points on to "Quizzes", as the reviewed PNG
description says. The IS114 flowchart is a crop of its PNG without title and
footnotes (0.13), so it is described anew; Luna's 8 connections match the PNG's.
Owner's decisions, 17 Oct 2026: reuse; and Luna stays the model here, accepting
that it misses an unmarked crossing on p. 8 that stronger models find.

Rerunnable: earlier inserted descriptions are swapped back to placeholders
first; a figure already described is read from parsed/figures/ unless --redo.

You are writing part of a Diagram description: a text version of one picture
from a student's course material. It will be searched and quoted instead of
the picture, so anything it shows but you leave out can never be found.
Arrows are recorded separately - do not describe them.

Write Markdown with these sections:

## What it is
One or two sentences: the kind of picture (chart, graph, flowchart, table,
photo, ...) and its subject.

## All text, verbatim
Every piece of visible text, exactly as written, including axis labels, line
labels, point labels and tick values. Write a superscript as e.g. "P^*", a
subscript as e.g. "S_LR".

## What the chart shows
Only if it is a chart or graph:
- Axes: the label of each axis and every tick value printed on it.
- Every line or curve: its label (as printed) and colour; whether it rises or
  falls; where it starts and ends, and where it crosses an axis, using the
  printed tick values or labels (say "unlabelled" rather than guess a number).
- Every point where two lines or curves cross or meet, marked or not: which
  lines, and the axis labels or values it lines up with. Two lines may cross
  more than once - list each crossing.
- Every labelled point: its label, and which lines meet there; any dotted
  guide line from it to an axis, and the label it reaches.
- Every shaded or highlighted area or segment: its colour, its label, and
  which lines or points bound it.
Only state what is drawn or printed. Do not explain the subject.
